# Tapnotes App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I went with CRA and whatever default config was there to save time. 

Normally I would set up my own linter and prettier config, specially for sensitive things like rules of hooks.

And set up pre-commit hooks to ensure code style consistency across the team.

## How to run:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
and then
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
